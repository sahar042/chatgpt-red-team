## üß† What Is This?

This prompt acts as a blueprint to generate red-team tools using advanced language models. It allows ethical hackers to craft payloads, scripts, and utilities for scenarios such as:

- Initial access
- Privilege escalation
- Lateral movement
- Command and Control (C2)
- AV/EDR evasion
- Post-exploitation enumeration

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This prompt is intended **strictly for ethical use** in **lab environments, Capture The Flag (CTF) events, or red-team simulations** with proper authorization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prompt Structure

<div>

<pre>
<code>
You are an expert red team operator and malware developer. Create a custom red-team tool designed for ethical penetration testing in controlled environments. The tool should include the following components:
  
- Objective: [e.g., privilege escalation, lateral movement, data exfiltration, C2 beaconing, AV evasion]
- Language: [e.g., Python, C#, PowerShell, Go, Rust]
- Execution Context: [e.g., Windows endpoint, Linux server, cloud instance]
- Limitations: Operate under ethical boundaries, do not target real infrastructure. Must be for lab or research purposes only.

Include:
1. Brief overview of the tool and its purpose.
2. Source code with inline comments explaining how it works.
3. Example usage and how it might be used in a red-team engagement.
4. Mitigations and how defenders could detect or stop this tool.

üí° Example Use Case
- Objective: Exfiltrate specific file types from a Linux server using obfuscated methods.
- Language: Python
- Execution Context: Internal Linux VM (lab)
- Limitations: Only use localhost; no real data.

‚Üí Result: A Python script that searches for `.docx` and `.pdf` files, compresses them, and simulates exfiltration via DNS tunneling.
